Wake up in the mornin' feelin' like P- Diddy (Hey what's up girl)
Grab ma glasses I'm out the door I'm gonna hit the city (Let's go)
Before I leave brush ma teeth with a bottle of Jack
'Cause when I leave for the night I ain't comin' back

I'm talkin' pedicure on our toes toes
Tryin' on all our clothes clothes
Boys blowin' up our phones phones

Drop top and playin' our favorite CD's
Goin' up to the parties
Tryna get a little bit tipsy

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
TiK ToK, on the clock
But the party don't stop no
Whoa-oh oh oh
Whoa-oh oh oh

Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, I'm'ma fight
Till we see the sunlight
TiK ToK, on the clock
But the party don't stop no
Whoa-oh oh oh
Whoa-oh oh oh

Katy:
I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys
Break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek
(At us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Ooh Oh Ooh

California girls
We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
Will melt your popsicle
Ooh Oh Ooh

California girls
We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Ooh Oh Ooh
(Justin Bieber)
Oh whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa, oh.
You know you love me, I know you care,
You shout whenever and I'll be there.
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart.
Are we an item? girl quit playing,
We're just friends, what are you saying.
Said there's another, look right in my eyes,
My first love broke my heart for the first time.
And I was like...

Baby, baby, baby ooh,
Like baby, baby, baby no,
Like baby, baby, baby, ooh.
Thought you'd always be mine, mine (repeat)''''''''''''''''
