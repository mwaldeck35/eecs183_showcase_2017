A big beautiful brain with a pretty face, yeah
A baby doll with a briefcase, yeah
A hot little hurricane
'Cause I'm feminine and soft, but I'm still a boss, yeah
Red lipstick but still so raw, yeah
Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck

'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
Smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping the clichs and norms all in a dress

Hey hey hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Faberg
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No o o o oh, no way
No o o o oh, no way
No o o o oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me

Yeah, I bounce back like a pro 'cause I'm so resilient
LOL at all your limits
Keep your penny thoughts, I'm making a mint

'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
Smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping the clichs and norms all in a dress

Hey hey hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Faberg
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No o o o oh, no way
No o o o oh, no way
No o o o oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me

I ain't got no strings
I'm no one's little puppet
Got my own cha ching
In my chubby little wallet
And secretly you love it
(You fucking love it)
And secretly you love it

Katy Perry & Astrid S:
Hey hey hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Faberg
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little baby
You think that I am fragile like a Faberg
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No o o o oh, no way (no)
No o o o oh, no way (no way)
No o o o oh, no way (uh-uh)
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me (br-br-break me)''''''''''''''''''''
