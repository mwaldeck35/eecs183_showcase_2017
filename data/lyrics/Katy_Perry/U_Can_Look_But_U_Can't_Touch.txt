Oh my god were you looking at her butt?

You're such a good boy and let's keep it the way
You're going out with your guys tonight
And you can flirt, boy, shut the window displays
They'll get you drunk, misbehave all right? All right!
Yeah... I let you walk the line 'cause you come home every time and I won't never give you reasons not to

You're such a good boy and let's keep it the way

You can look, but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch (ah)
You can look, but you can't touch, you can look at her butt (her butt)
You can look, but you can't touch her butt (ah)
Don't touch! Don't even think about it!

I'll b your bad girl, when you came lately tonight, I can treat you and feed your appetite
U wouldn't dare leave me home alone too long and get me thinking something's really wrong
Yeah, I'll let it you draw my line, you'll be the captain every time
I'll let you think you're in control of this shit

You're such a good a boy and let's keep it the way

I saw you looking at her butt, it's a J E L L O
You say you get me another drink, but I sawyo you say hello
You think I'm blind, you think I'm deaf, and you think that I'm dumb

Don't you forget Punk ...

You can look, but you can't touch
You can look, don't touch (don't touch), you can look but you can't touch (ah)
